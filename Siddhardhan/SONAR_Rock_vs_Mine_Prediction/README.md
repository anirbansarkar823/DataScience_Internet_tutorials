Goal: To determine whether the object beneath the submarine is a mine or a rock using SONAR data.

Data collection: In laboratory setup, the data has been collected based on experimentation done over a rock and metal cylinder.

Data collection --> Data pre-processing --> Train/Test Data --> Logistic Regression Model (as logistic regression is good for binary classification)


Dataset:
    - 208 data points
    - Target variable: R-rock; M-Metal
    - 60 features (unnamed)
