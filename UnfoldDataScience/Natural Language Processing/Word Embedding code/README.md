Word Embedding: Numerical Representation of words

Types:
1. Frequency Based word embedding (eg. count vectorizer, tfidf, co-occurrence matrix [gloVe]).

2. Prediction Based word embedding - here we try to capture the context of a word. We try to predict based of previous/ nearby words (eg. cbow, skip-gram). word2vec (by google) is prediction based.
